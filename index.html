        <h1><i>RGB</i>, 2023-2024</h1>
        <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js</p>
        <p>
          <i>RGB</i> is an interactive exploration into how computers store and
          interpret images as data. It is also an investigation of websites as a
          form of digital installation. When interacting with <i>RGB</i>,
          players are forced to <i>think</i> like a computer, to deconstruct
          digital media into its pixels consisting of the only three colors
          computers know: red, green, and blue.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Process</h2>
        <p>
          Screens display media through pixels, individual points of light that
          combine red, green, and blue additively to display 16,777,216 possible
          colors. RGB examines each of these pixels in an image, comparing its
          red, green, and blue values, or RGB values. The work features three 3D
          panes, one corresponding to each of these colors. In each pane, every
          pixelâ€™s RGB values are compared. If the corresponding color is
          dominant, then that pixel is tinted and displayed; otherwise, it is
          transparent. Interacting with each slider adjusts the bias for its
          corresponding color.
        </p>
        <h2>Interactions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click the central image pane to toggle pane alignment.</li>
          <li>
            Click the outer image panes when unaligned to navigate
            three-dimensionally.
          </li>
          <li>Drag the sliders to adjust the red, green, and blue bias.</li>
          <li>Click the refresh button to receive a random image.</li>
          <li>Click the upload button to upload an image from your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i>Fakebook</i>, 2022</h3>
        <p>C++, openFrameworks</p>
        <div class="iframe-container">
          <iframe
            src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u9spCYFU7Z8DbRKU8yqY61xa_7elFUuJ/preview"
          ></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          <i>Fakebook</i> is an equivocal social media application that utilizes
          AI to randomly generate an infinite quantity of images for the player
          to consume, adapting to their behavior over time. It does this through
          an algorithm that first generates random keywords, then uses the
          OpenAI DALL-E 2 API to generate an image with those keywords, and
          finally analyzes the player's behavior to reutilize keywords that
          promote engagement. The work itself is an experiment to see if
          artificial content can effectively captivate a user. It also deals
          with themes of social media addiction and consumption.

        <h3><i>Efedor Station</i>, 2023</h3>
        <p>Godot, Blender</p>
        <img
          src="./assets/efedor-station.png"
          alt="Efedor Station screenshot"
        />
        <p>
          <i>Efedor Station</i> is a 3D exploration game set in an enclosed
          forest environment. The player must collect golden coins scattered
          throughout the world, chopping down trees to use the logs as a fuel
          source to light their way. The game is a commentary on the nature of
          capitalism and how it drives the act of deforestation, as well as an
          analysis of player behavior.

        <h3><i>Textural Threshold Hair Salon: Dreadlock</i>, 2023</h3>
        <p>Python, HTML, CSS</p>
        <img
          src="https://static.labiennale.org/files/styles/full_screen_slide/public/architettura/2023/1300x600/softlab1.jpg"
          alt="Textural Threshold Hair Salon: Dreadlock image"
        />
        <p>
          <i>Textural Threshold Hair Salon: Dreadlock</i> was a technical
          collaboration with professors Felecia Davis, Huijuan Xu, and Shu Zhao.
          It was an interactive installation on display at Venice Architecture
          Biennale 2023. The work allowed users to sit in a chair and have a
          screenshot taken of the back of their head, which was then compared to
          a database of hair types to display positive and negative matches. I
          was responsible for automating the exhibition, creating a program that
          interfaced with the various hardware and software components to
          provide a seamless user experience.
